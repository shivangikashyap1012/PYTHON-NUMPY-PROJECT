NumPy Mini Project

This project contains two small tasks using NumPy for data analysis:

ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Sensor Data Analysis

The robot collects sensor readings such as temperature, distance, and battery level during operation.
The program:

Loads sensor readings from sensor_data.csv

Calculates average, minimum, maximum for each sensor

Finds the time when temperature was highest

Counts how many times battery dropped below 30%

Saves results into sensor_results.txt

ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Robot Path Analysis

The robot moves in a 2D grid world with positions logged in robot_path.csv.
The program:

Loads robot positions from CSV

Calculates the total distance traveled

Finds the farthest point from origin (0,0)

Detects if the robot ever revisited the same position

Saves results into robot_results.txt

ðŸ›  Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Install NumPy if not already installed:

pip install numpy

ðŸš€ How to Run

Place the CSV files (sensor_data.csv, robot_path.csv) in the same folder as the scripts.

Run the Python scripts:

python project1_sensor.py
python project2_robot.py


Check the output files:

sensor_results.txt

robot_results.txt
