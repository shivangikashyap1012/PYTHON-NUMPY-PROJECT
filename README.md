# NumPy Mini Project

This project contains two small tasks using **NumPy** for data analysis:

## ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Sensor Data Analysis

The robot collects sensor readings such as **temperature, distance, and
battery level** during operation.\
The program:\
- Loads sensor readings from `sensor_data.csv`\
- Calculates **average, minimum, maximum** for each sensor\
- Finds the **time when temperature was highest**\
- Counts how many times **battery dropped below 30%**\
- Saves results into `sensor_results.txt`

## ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Robot Path Analysis

The robot moves in a **2D grid world** with positions logged in
`robot_path.csv`.\
The program:\
- Loads robot positions from CSV\
- Calculates the **total distance traveled**\
- Finds the **farthest point from origin (0,0)**\
- Detects if the robot ever **revisited the same position**\
- Saves results into `robot_results.txt`
